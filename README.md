# Python Developer Assessment
This repository is for my developer assessment tasks.

# Project Overview
This project contains all tasks completed for the Python Developer Assessment.  
It includes Python basics, Git/GitHub workflow, data structures & algorithms, OOP, debugging, error handling, code style tools, and API interaction.

# Completed Tasks
### *Phase 1: Setup & Foundational Review*
- **Task 1.1: "Hello World" Confirmation** – `hello.py` Setup & Foundational Review
- **Task 1.2: GitHub Repository Setup & First Branch** – initial repo setup and branch workflow
- **Task 1.3: Apply Code Style & Linting** – `bad_style.py` using Black and Flake8

### *Phase 2: Core Programming Concepts & Problem Solving*
- **Task 2.1: Data Structure & Algorithm Challenges** – `dsa_challenges.py` Basic Data Structures & Algorithms
- **Task 2.2: Implement a Book Class** – `book_store.py` Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals
- **Task 2.3: Debugging and Error Handling** – `debug_errors.py` Error Handling & Debugging

### *Phase 3: Integration*
- **Task 3.1: Fetch and Process API Data** – `api_client.py` Basic API Interaction
- **Task 3.2: Final Submission Preparation** – merging all branches into `main`

#  Reflections
### **Most Challenging**
The most challenging part of this assessment was working with multiple Git branches and merging them back into the main branch with sloving the issues. It required careful attention and helped me better understand proper version control workflow.

### **Most Interesting**
The API interaction task was the most interesting for me. Fetching real user data, handling errors, and parsing JSON made the project feel more practical and connected to real-world applications.

### **Something I Learned / Improved**
I improved my understanding of Python code quality tools like Black and Flake8, learned how to organize my project across branches, and became more confident with debugging and handling errors in Python.

# Conclusion
This assessment helped me strengthen my Python skills, improve my understanding of Git workflows, and gain hands-on experience with debugging, API usage, and code quality tools. Completing each task step-by-step gave me more confidence in writing clean, structured, and maintainable code. Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience that reinforced good development practices and prepared me for real-world programming challenges.
